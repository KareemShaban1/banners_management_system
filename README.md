Purpose
This application aims to make creating, managing, scheduling, and delivering banner images and content simple for marketing teams and site administrators. It supports multiple banner types, placement management, scheduling by date/time, and basic analytics hooks.

Key features
- Create and manage banners (image, HTML, or rich text)
- Define banner placements (header, sidebar, footer, custom slots)
- Schedule start/end times and priorities for banner rotation
- Enable/disable banners and set target audiences or pages
- Upload and manage media assets (images, thumbnails)
- Preview banners and placements in the admin UI
- Basic export/import for banner lists (CSV/JSON)
- Responsive, styled admin interface using Blade templates and CSS/SCSS
- AJAX interactions for inline editing, activation toggles, and quick previews

Built with
- PHP (Laravel recommended)
- Blade templates for views
- JavaScript for client-side interactions (AJAX, previews)
- CSS / SCSS for styling and responsive layout
- MySQL / MariaDB (or other supported DB) for persistent storage

Installation (Laravel-style)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/KareemShaban1/banners_management_system.git
   cd banners_management_system

2. Install PHP dependencies:
   composer install

3. Install frontend dependencies (if package.json exists):
   npm install
   npm run dev   # or npm run build for production

4. Setup environment:
   cp .env.example .env
   Edit .env with DB credentials and APP_URL

5. Generate app key:
   php artisan key:generate

6. Run database migrations and (optionally) seed sample data:
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed --class=BannerSeeder

7. Serve the app:
   php artisan serve

Configuration
- config/banners.php (if present): configure default placements, file size limits, storage disk, allowed file types.
- .env variables:
  - APP_URL
  - DB_* (database)
  - FILESYSTEM_DRIVER (local, s3, etc.)
  - BANNER_DEFAULT_DURATION (optional default schedule window)

Usage
- Admin routes (example): Visit /admin/banners to create and manage banners.
- Create a banner: provide title, image or HTML content, placement, start/end datetime, priority, and optional target URL/classes.
- Schedule and preview banners: use the preview button or the placement preview page to see how banners will appear.
- Export/Import: use the tools page to export banners as CSV/JSON or import them for bulk updates.


Import / Export & Backup
- Export banners to CSV or JSON for backup or migration.
- Import expects a specific column layout (title, placement, start_at, end_at, image_path, priority, active). Confirm exact field order from the import controller or update import parser accordingly.
- Back up uploaded assets (public/uploads/) when migrating environments.

Development notes
- Blade templates live in resources/views — modify markup and components here.
- Styles and SCSS are under resources/css and resources/scss — compile using the project's frontend build (npm/webpack/mix).
- JavaScript behavior (AJAX saving, previews) is under resources/js.
- Routes are defined in routes/web.php. Check middleware for admin authentication.
- Check app/Models for the Banner and Placement schemas to understand relationships and available attributes.

Testing
- Add PHPUnit tests under tests/ for controllers, models, and import/export logic.
- For UI flows (preview, scheduling), consider Laravel Dusk or Playwright for end-to-end tests.

Contributing
1. Fork the project.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
3. Commit changes with clear messages.
4. Submit a Pull Request describing the change and why it's needed.
- Follow coding conventions used in the project and add tests for new behavior.

Troubleshooting
- File upload permission errors: ensure storage/ and public/uploads/ are writable by the webserver.
- Missing images in preview: confirm the file path and storage disk (local vs S3). Run php artisan storage:link if using public storage.
- Scheduling not working: check timezone settings in config/app.php and ensure start/end datetimes are saved in the correct timezone.

Security considerations
- Validate and sanitize uploaded files (mime type, size, extension).
- Protect admin routes with authentication and authorization (middlewares, policies).
- Escape or sanitize banner HTML if you allow raw HTML content from non-trusted users.

Add a LICENSE file to the repository and state the license here (e.g., MIT). If no license is provided, the repository defaults to "All rights reserved."
